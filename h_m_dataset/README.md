# H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations Dataset

Data is **not stored in the repo** (too large). To match the project’s current layout, download and place the three CSVs below.

## Source

- **Competition:** [H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations) on Kaggle
- **Data page:** [Competition Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data) (Kaggle account and competition acceptance required)

## Target layout (same as current instantiation)

Place files so the structure is:

```
h_m_dataset/
├── README.md                 (this file)
├── articles.csv
├── customers.csv
└── transactions_train.csv
```

## Steps

1. Go to the [competition Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/data) tab and accept the rules if prompted.
2. Download:
   - `articles.csv`
   - `customers.csv`
   - `transactions_train.csv`
3. Put all three files in `676_Project/h_m_dataset/` (same directory as this README).

No renaming or subfolders needed. After this, `HM_DIR` in the project will point at the same layout as the current instantiation.
